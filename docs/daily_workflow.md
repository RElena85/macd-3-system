## 🌅 1. Morning Routine: "The 5-Minute Scan"
**Time Required:** 5-10 Minutes
**Goal:** Define the daily bias and build the watchlist.

### Step A: Check Daily Bias (The Trend Filter)
Open your **Master Indicator** on the **Daily Timeframe**.
*   **Action:** Look at the Zero Line background color.
    *   🟢 **Green / Above Zero:** Today is **Long-Only** for this asset.
    *   🔴 **Red / Below Zero:** Today is **Short-Only** for this asset.
*   *Result:* Ignore any trade signals that go against this color.

### Step B: Identify Setups (The Watchlist)
Switch to the **4H Timeframe** (Setup Chart).
*   **Trend Check:** Is the MACD line far from the zero line (not in the chop zone)?
*   **Reversal Check:** Do you see Divergence lines currently forming?
*   **Selection:** Pick top 2-3 assets that look clear. Ignore messy charts.

## 🔔 2. Monitoring Phase: "Set and Forget"
**Time Required:** 0 Minutes (Passive)
**Goal:** Let the system watch the internal price action.

### Step A: Activate Alerts
*   On your selected watchlist assets, ensure your alerts are active.
*   **Focus:** You are waiting for the **1H Timeframe** (Trigger Chart) to align.

### Step B: Walk Away
*   Close the charts.
*   Do not stare at the screen.
*   Wait for the notification on your phone or desktop.

## ⚡ 3. Alert & Verification Phase
**Time Required:** 5 Minutes per Alert
**Goal:** Qualify the signal before risking money.

**Trigger:** *Phone pings "LONG ENTRY SIGNAL - Grade A"*

### Step A: The 3-Point Validation
Open the chart to the **1H Timeframe**.
1.  **Bias Check:** Is Daily still Green?
2.  **Trigger Check:** Did the Histogram just flip color or show a pattern?
3.  **Structure Check:** Look left. Is price bouncing off a Support Level (for Longs) or Resistance (for Shorts)?

### Step B: The Candle Close Rule
*   **Review:** Has the current 1-hour candle **CLOSED**?
*   **Action:** If the candle is still moving, WAIT. Signals often disappear before the close.
*   **Execute:** Only proceed if the signal remains valid at the close.

## 🔫 4. Execution Phase
**Time Required:** 2 Minutes
**Goal:** Enter the market with defined risk.

### Step A: Calculate Risk
*   Use the *Long/Short Position Tool* in TradingView.
*   **Entry:** Current Price.
*   **Stop Loss:** Below the recent Swing Low (for Longs) or above Swing High (for Shorts).
*   **Risk:** Adjust quantity so loss = 1% of account balance.

### Step B: Place Orders
1.  **Entry Order:** Market or Limit.
2.  **Stop Loss:** **HARD RULE** - Place immediately.
3.  **Take Profit:** Place Limit order at **2R** (Entry + 2x Risk).

## 🛡️ 5. Management Phase: "The Trail"
**Time Required:** Passive
**Goal:** Protect capital and lock in profits.

### Scenario A: Stop Loss Hit ❌
*   **Action:** Do nothing. Accept the loss.
*   **Mindset:** "This was a business expense."

### Scenario B: Target 1 (2R) Hit ✅
*   **Action:** Close **50%** of the position.
*   **Defense:** Move Stop Loss to **Breakeven** (Entry Price).
*   **Result:** Risk-free trade.

### Scenario C: Exit Signal ⚠️
*   **Trigger:** Alert "Opposite Crossover" (e.g., Bearish Cross while Long).
*   **Action:** Close the remaining 50% of the position manually.

## 📝 6. Evening Review
**Time Required:** 5 Minutes
**Goal:** Constant improvement.

1.  **Log:** Record the trade in your journal.
2.  **Screenshot:** Capture the chart with entry/exit points.
3.  **Review:** Did I break any rules? (FOMO, ignoring chop, etc.)

---

### 🧠 Mental Reset Mandates
*   **No Alerts = No Trade.** Do not force a trade because you are bored.
*   **Respect the Zero Line.** It is the law.
*   **Cash is a Position.** Being out of the market during chop is profitable.
